# Canonical build → install → clean helper for the NEAT-AI Rust siblings.
#
# COPY CONTRACT (Issue #680): this file has one home — `scripts/runlib.sh` on
# NEAT-AI-core `Develop`. Every Rust sibling copies it byte-for-byte into its
# own `scripts/runlib.sh`; behaviour changes are made *here* and re-copied
# outward, never edited downstream. See README.md → "Canonical runlib.sh".
#
# Run it from the repository root of the sibling, or source it and call
# `runlib_install`. It:
#
#   * resolves the single workspace member — the root crate, or the one
#     `[workspace] members` entry — and fails loud on zero or more than one;
#   * installs the bin target named after the crate to `$CARGO_HOME/bin/<crate>`
#     and a `cdylib` target to `$CARGO_HOME/lib/lib<crate>.{so,dylib}`, both
#     with `-` → `_` in the crate name (CARGO_HOME defaults to `~/.cargo`). A
#     crate carrying both targets installs both. The installed names come from
#     the *crate*, never from the cargo target name, so the skip below looks
#     the artefacts up under the same names the install wrote;
#   * writes the stamp `.<crate>.version` — the crate semver — beside every
#     artefact it installs, and writes it *last*;
#   * runs **no** `cargo` command at all when artefact and stamp already match,
#     printing exactly one stderr line `[<crate>] already installed v<x>`.
#     There is no force flag: delete the stamp to force a rebuild;
#   * removes the checkout's `target/` after a successful install and names the
#     path removed and the bytes freed on stderr; a build directory outside the
#     checkout (a shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) is kept, and that is reported. Any
#     failure keeps `target/` and leaves the installed artefacts and their
#     stamps untouched — every artefact is staged and moved into place only
#     once all of them are ready;
#   * honours the caller's RUSTFLAGS unchanged and sets no flags of its own;
#   * prints the installed bin path — or the lib path when there is no bin —
#     on stdout, and nothing else on stdout.
#
# With no `rustc` on PATH the toolchain is bootstrapped here (Issue #699):
# rustup is installed from the pinned `rustup-init` for the host target, whose
# SHA-256 must match the digest inlined below before the downloaded file is
# executed. It is never `curl https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` — that runs whatever
# the distribution point served, and what it installs then compiles every
# `build.rs` in the dependency graph. Every verification failure — an unknown
# host target, no pinned digest, no SHA-256 tool, a failed download, a digest
# mismatch — exits non-zero naming the cause, having executed nothing. With
# `rustc` already present nothing is downloaded, and `rustup` itself is never
# invoked. `jq` stays a plain precondition: a missing one exits non-zero
# naming it.
#
# To bump rustup, change `_RUNLIB_RUSTUP_VERSION` and every digest in
# `_runlib_pinned_rustup_digest` together — they are one pin, and a version
# moved without its digests can only fail closed.
#
# MSRV comes from `rust-version` in the crate manifest when present; a
# `rust-toolchain.toml` is honoured by rustup itself.
#
# Run it as a subprocess — `path="$(./scripts/runlib.sh)"`. It can also be
# sourced, but note that sourcing applies `set -euo pipefail` to the calling
# shell, prepends `$CARGO_HOME/bin` to its PATH, clears any EXIT/INT/TERM trap
# the caller had set, and that any failure exits that shell rather than
# returning to it.
